# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Learning Repository

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol designed to enable AI models to interact with various system components and services in a standardized way. It provides a structured approach for:

- File system operations
- System commands
- API interactions
- Tool integrations
- Context management

## Key Components of MCP

1. **Protocol Definition**: Standardized way for models to request and receive information
2. **Server Components**: Various servers handling different types of operations (filesystem, API, etc.)
3. **Tool Integration**: Ability to integrate with different tools and services
4. **Context Management**: Handling context and state for model interactions

## Configuration Example

Basic MCP filesystem server configuration:
```json
{
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "<workspace_path>"
      ]
    }
}
```

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository serves as a learning ground for understanding and implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Here you'll find:
- Examples of MCP configurations
- Usage patterns
- Best practices
- Implementation guides

## Getting Started

1. Install MCP server components:
   ```bash
   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
   ```

2. Configure your MCP servers
3. Implement protocol handlers
4. Test model interactions
